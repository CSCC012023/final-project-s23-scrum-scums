In next 13 you can label a react function component as client-side rendered ("use client")
or server-side which is the default.

Some react components we import for the app may need interactivity and need to be client side rendered.
Since by default next doesn't do that, we need to make a provider component that just returns the original component and calls 'use client' on it.
