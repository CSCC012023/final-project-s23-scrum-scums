# Obelisk

## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: August, 4th, 7:00 pm
 * Where: Online through Zoom

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

- Remote pair programming where we had two people working together, actively discussing and reviewing each line of code. This gave each member a greater understanding of what was happening in the project.

- Investing some time in tooling by writing seed scripts allowed us to rapidly iterate with the database.

- Having 2 people deep dive a subject turned out much better. They were able to keep each other's knowledge in check.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
- Having one person deep dive and then try to share their subject knowledge. This was unintuitive and we ended up having to all study it in the end anyways. 
- Having everyone present for stand-up meetings
#### Planned changes
- Order the tasks we do so that we can remove blockers early on
