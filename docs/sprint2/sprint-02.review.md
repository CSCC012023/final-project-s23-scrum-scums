## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 7th, 5:00 pm
 * Where: Online through Zoom

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Remote pair programming where we had two people working together, actively discussing and reviewing each line of code. This gave each member a greater understanding of what was happening in the project.

Investing some time in tooling by writing seed scripts allowed us to rapidly iterate with the database.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
- Having one person deep dive and then try to share their subject knowledge. This was unintuitive and we ended up having to all study it in the end anyways. 
- Having everyone present for stand-up meetings
#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

- Order the tasks we do so that we can remove blockers early on

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

- OBELISK-32 - Sessions
- OBELISK-5 - Infinite Scrolling
- OBELISK-33 - Searching
- OBELISK-37 - Markdown Toolbar
- OBELISK-34 - Prisma Seeding


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

OBELISK-33 - Searching was split into component pieces and some of the functionality was pushed back by a split since the original subject matter was too large in scope and difficult.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process

Make sure it's easy to iterate and prototype things. Work on documentation and types to achieve this. Make development frictionless.
Start building out a large backend service for creating personalized feeds.
Implement the rest of the Search user tasks and possibly use Elasticsearch
