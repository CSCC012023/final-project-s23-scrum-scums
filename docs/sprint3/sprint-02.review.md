## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 21th, 6:00 pm
 * Where: Online through Discord

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

Remote pair programming where we had two people working together, actively discussing and reviewing each line of code. This gave each member a greater understanding of what was happening in the project.

Investing some time in tooling by writing seed scripts allowed us to rapidly iterate with the database.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Having one person deep dive and then try to share their subject knowledge. This was unintuitive and we ended up having to all study it in the end anyways. 
- Having everyone present for stand-up meetings

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- Order the tasks we do so that we can remove blockers early on

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- OBELISK-32 - Sessions
- OBELISK-5 - Infinite Scrolling
- OBELISK-33 - Searching
- OBELISK-37 - Markdown Toolbar
- OBELISK-34 - Prisma Seeding


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

OBELISK-33 - Searching was split into component pieces and some of the functionality was pushed back by a split since the original subject matter was too large in scope and difficult.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Make sure it's easy to iterate and prototype things. Work on documentation and types to achieve this. Make development frictionless.
Start building out a large backend service for creating personalized feeds.
Implement the rest of the Search user tasks and possibly use Elasticsearch
